# SwyftOnline

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
Swyft Online is the client-side implementation of Swyft's web infrastructure. The client is wholly based on Ember.js using the ember-cli platform and interacts with the SwyftAPI Sails.js-based server.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM) and [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* Ensure that an instance of SwyftAPI is running locally on [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337).
* `ember server`
* Visit SwyftOnline at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

SwyftOnline currently does not have tests setup. The following is directly from ember-cli documentation.

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Deploying

SwyftAPI and SwyftOnline, the server-side and client-side implementations of Swyft's web infrastructure, respectively, are developed separately in order to promote modularity and stability. 

For production, however, the SwyftOnline project is hosted with the SwyftAPI server. SwyftOnline must be built with the `ember build --environment="production"` flag. The resulting production files, located with in the `dist` folder of your SwyftOnline folder, must then be placed within the `assets/SwyftOnline` folder in the SwyftAPI project. The contents of the `index.html` file must be copied into the `homepage.ejs` view file within the SwyftAPI project. 

Lastly, using any text editor with a Find and Replace function, you must replace `"assets/"` with `"/SwyftOnline/assets/` in the homepage.ejs file. `(images/` must be replaced with `(/SwyftOnline/images/` in the swyft-online css file. `"images/` must be replaced with `"/SwyftOnline/images/`.

Following these steps, use the SwyftAPI deployment guide to deploy the project.

A Grunt task is available that automatically runs the above steps:

* `ember build --environment="production"`
* `grunt default` in the root Swyft directory
* Follow SwyftAPI deployment guide

#Features
##CSS
Swyft Epsilon Online extends Bootstrap Cosmo.

Be careful when editing CSS as certain classes originally intended for a specific use might have been repurposed elsewhere.
##Animations
As of SwyftOnline 2.6, new features were added to allow for animating route transitions. Wrap the body of the content you want to animate in and out with an `animate-body` component.

> `{{#animate-body}}
> //Content to animate
> {{/animate-body}}`

By using the animate-body component, animate in transitions are automatically enabled. You can change the delay before the animation begins by setting the animateDelay property on the animate-body component. To animate out of a route, simply add the `animate-out-route` mixin to the route of the page.


Ember's fully asynchronous router doesn't immediately lend itself to animating through route changes, meaning the current methods of doing so will seem slightly hacked together. However, the Ember team is taking a look at how to allow for this functionality in a more elegant manner.

##Modals
SwyftOnline has its own modal system based on the Bootstrap Modal component. This modal system is exposed as an Ember Component, instead of opting for an outlet based method. 

There are three types of modals, the first is a standard `modal-dialog` with a dynamically set body of text and a close button. This first modal is best used to replace a JavaScript alert, as it is only designed to present data with no user input. The second is `modal-dialog-dynamic` that is available with a block helper that allows you to dynamically set the body of the modal to any HTML and Handlebars markup. This allows for flexibility in what you present to the user, however, it also doesn't allow for user input. The last type of modal is a `confirmation-dialog`, which is based on the `modal-dialog` component with options for user input.

##Authentication
SwyftOnline is designed for token-based authentication. There are multiple mixins available to regulate routes by authentication status. The `authenticated-route` mixin restricts pages to authenticated users only. The `admin-route` and `delivery-route` mixins restrict access to authenticated administrators and authenticated delivery personnel, respectively.

##Admin Utilities
SwyftOnline provides components for building modular administrative interfaces. All administrative routes that use the admin-navigation component must have a currentRoute property within their controller.
##HTML Helpers
###Decimal Rendering
The `render-decimal` and `render-decimal-simple` helpers aid in rendering decimal values properly. This is especilally useful when rendering prices, so that a value of 2.3 will appear as 2.30.
###Text Capitalization
The `capitalize-letters` helper calls `toUpperCase()` on string values to capitalizate them. This can be done with the CSS `text-transform` property as well.
###Dynamic Property
The `dynamic-property` allows for dynamic properties to be rendered into Ember templates. The helper also supports nested object properties as well. 
Usage:
`{{dynamic-property object propertyName}}`
##Utilities
SwyftOnline provides utility helpers for different parts of the application.
##Notes
###Admin CRUD Pagination
Records per page is hardcoded on the route page of each Admin CRUD page. It is passed to the server, which passes it to MetaService. So the server treats recordsPerPage dynamically.

###Routes
All consumer facing pages should implement the `SidebarRouteMixin` and all admin pages the `AdminRouteMixin`. 
###Time Zones
Swyft Online automatically converts dates to EST time using Moment.js because Swyft only operates in the New England region. This also ensures that dates and times appear normally to our administrators when they are not in the New England region.
###Admin CRUD Notes
When creating a new data record or editing an existing one, you will see three types of inputs. One is a normal white input, one is a grayed out input and the last is a grayed out read only input. The grayed out input means that you can edit the data, but it's not recommended in most situations. 

If changing the total amount on an order, leave the total amount intact just to show how much the order would have costed, and then simply edit the actual amount and then be sure to leave an admin comment of how much the actual amount was originally and how much it was changed to. Be aware that changing the total amount doesn't automatically charge the user again for payment methods such as Swyft Debit or Credit Card. The recommended course of action is to simply add this as a deduction in the customer's Swyft Debit balance, and allow them to pay it off however they choose.
