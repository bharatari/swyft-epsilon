# SwyftApp
SwyftApp is a modern and standards-complaint web application built on Node.js and Ember.js. For development purposes, SwyftApp is further divided into two subsets, SwyftAPI for Swyft's server-side infrastructure and SwyftOnline for Swyft's web app client.
##Roadmap
SwyftApp was recently rebuilt from the ground up to be more modular and extensible. One of the long term goals for this project is to create an application framework based on current code that can be used to build modern applications for small businesses. 
##Contribute
We're always looking for bright and motivated individuals to help us continue development. If you have experience contributing to open-source frameworks, we would love to bring you on board to begin working on Swyft Next, our planned framework for the future.
