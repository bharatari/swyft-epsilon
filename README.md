# Swyft
Swyft is a modern and standards-complaint web application built on Node.js and Ember.js. For development purposes, Swyft is further divided into two subsets, SwyftAPI for Swyft's server-side infrastructure and SwyftOnline for Swyft's web app client.
##Roadmap
Swyft was rebuilt from the ground up to be more modular and extensible. One of the long term goals for this project is to create an application framework based on current code that can be used to build modern applications for small businesses.
