# Swyft Epsilon
Swyft Epsilon is a modern and standards-complaint web application built on Node.js and Ember.js. For development purposes, Epsilon is further divided into two subsets, Swyft Epsilon API (formerly `SwyftAPI`) for Swyft's server-side infrastructure and Swyft Epsilon Online (formerly `SwyftOnline`) for Swyft's web app client. For documentation purposes, `Swyft`, `Swyft App`, `Epsilon` and `Swyft Epsilon` are used interchangeably.
##Roadmap
Swyft was rebuilt from the ground up to be more modular and extensible. One of the long term goals for this project is to create an application framework based on current code that can be used to build modern applications for small businesses.
